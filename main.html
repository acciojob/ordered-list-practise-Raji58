	<h2>Code Optimization Explanation<h2>
	<p>we can optimze solution using both time and space Optimization. To Optimization a program,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>we can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied </li>
		<li>we can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it's total run time</li>
		<li>we can reduce the both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms</li>
